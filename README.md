NodeJS scraper that fetches all the links of post from home page of medium.com and recursively fetches all the links from those posts.


# Setup application
Run the command 'npm i' in root directory to install all the depedencies.
Dependencies used:-
1) cheerio - Able to use Jquery while scraping data from web.
2) puppeteer - to load dynamic JS generated by website.
3) fs - to create and save data into file.

# Run code 
1) run the command 'node index.js' which will run a function that fetches all the links of posts on home page of medium.com. Since medium.com uses dynamic JS to load its content that's why puppeteer has been used that loads dynamic JS.

2) All the links fetched will be saved in 'links.txt' file in form of object. Each object consists of the link of the post and an array of it's internal URLs.

3) cheerio has been used in order to use jquery in scraped data.

4) Max connections have been set up to only 5 and number of jobs running initially are 0 which later on increases by 1 and as each job finishes, it again decreases by 1, in order to maintain concurrency we are checking if the number of current running jobs is less than max connections or not.
